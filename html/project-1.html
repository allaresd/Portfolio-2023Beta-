                      <p>Providence Research (a BC healthcare research institution) is exploring the Woundification app to understand its feasibility as a platform for wound care awareness. They aim to develop a mid-fidelity prototype to identify wounds and assist with the healing progress. During near 3 month collaboration, our team helped them identify the constraints and possibilities from the market, user as well as the technical side. We also delivered a Hi-Fi UI mock-up for further development. </p>

                      <p>For people who are suffering from slow healing or chronic wounds and would like to learn more about the condition of their wound and possible treatment options, Woundification is an easy-to-use mobile application which uses a series of assessment questions to understand the condition and classification of wounds. Unlike Swift Skin and Wounds and Swift Ray 1, which are focused more on healthcare professionals, our product focuses on enabling everyday users to gain easy-to-understand medical knowledge about wound conditions.</p>

                <h3><span class="takeaways-icon"></span>Key takeaways</h3>
                <h4>Things that I will keep:</h4>
                <p> Stay critical thinking and take timely actions in terms of project process and product. I identified and timely solved the version issues that hindered successors from identifying which one was the finalized style guide and improved the efficiency of the process. </p>
                <p>Keep professional in things that I am good at. I really love and am skilled in visualizing information via motions, so I took the lead in making the trailer and delivered it timely with serval iterations.</p>
                <p>Care about inclusive design. Inclusive design embraces everyone and has become more feasible and necessary nowadays. For this application which is also designed for patients with a wide age range, we let users personalize the font size at their will, which I think is a continuation of the fine traditions. </p>

                <h4>Things that I will do differently:</h4>
                <p>Have early team bonding activities. Collective activities could be a good chance for teammates to understand each other’s boundaries and communication styles by providing characteristic perspectives. This will greatly help build team trust, which significantly improves the teamwork ethos. However, mostly, we are remote and online meetings discourage such a possibility. This had improved a little in late production, but if we could start earlier, things would become easier for everyone.</p>
                <p>Boost professional knowledge from practitioners. For health app designers, it's important to have a grasp of basic medical knowledge on wounds and wound care with the help of medical practitioners prior to embarking on development. On the one hand, apps that provide accurate and reliable information can be trusted by patients, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders in the healthcare industry. On the other hand, by understanding the basics of wound care, developers can design apps that are user-friendly and easy to navigate. They can include relevant information such as wound types, causes, and treatments, which can help users make informed decisions about their care.</p>
                <p>Condense ideas while ready for elaboration. Simplifying complex or lengthy information can reduce the cost of communication. To do this, I may focus on the main points, use simpler language, and remove unnecessary details. Meanwhile, it's important to be able to elaborate on these ideas when needed to maintain team trust. They follow the user-oriented idea and are not controversial in essence.</p>
