                      <p>Justice Institute of British Columbia’s Centre for Conflict Resolution currently lacks a personalized tool to help their students to better prepare for the possible interpersonal conflicts in daily life that references conflict resolution course materials. This project aims to develop an AI-powered cross-platform application to help users learn conflict resolution skills and prepare for possible interpersonal conflicts in daily life. The app will integrate with JIBC’s conflict resolution course content.  </p>

                      <p>The MVP for this project is a cross-platform application that allows users to better handle interpersonal conflict by conversing with a chatbot and receiving guidance, recommendations, and suggestions suited to their personal scenarios. The app will include a hybrid of rule-based and AI to power the chatbot. The AI will be powered by OpenAPI’s ChatGPT API to provide more human-like conversational abilities. The chatbot will be able to offer its wisdom on things such as body language, tone, phrasing, open questions, and more tailored to the specific conflict the user describes. Another feature that the MVP will include is that the chatbot will be able to guide the user through the 5 stages of conflict resolution as defined in JIBC’s course <i>(Invitation, Connection, Exchange, Agreement, and Reflection).</i> The MVP will also include the ability for the user to share or export a message or messages between the chatbot and the user. </p>

                <h3><span class="takeaways-icon"></span>Key takeaways</h3>
                <h4>Things that I will keep:</h4>
                <p> Keep bravely asking questions about product design and stay alignment. The major design challenge was to create a feasible user flow, and I identified the core design problem and helped the designer and developers solve the problem together. One of our designers was initially in charge of it, but it wasn't clear at an implemental level. For example, while identifying the stages, the way of finding the accurate stage was up in the air; whether manually selecting or being identified by the program mattered to the user experience and development difficulty. Those unthought-out problems may lead to significant issues in future development, so I cleaned out the user flow and translated designers’ questions and proposals to developers, leaving more time to discuss the feasibility and make sure everyone was on the same page. The outcome was prominent, and we had a better understanding of the product.  </p>
                <p>Integrate external resources proactively when doing something from scratch. Initially, I had no clue about legal documents and adapted myself to compile this sort of document. Our clients express legitimate concerns regarding the privacy implications associated with data usage, particularly in light of our intention to utilize their course materials for model training purposes. As crafting a legally compliant document proves to be unfamiliar territory for everyone, compiling the requisite information and establishing a coherent framework presents considerable challenges. In response, I proactively sought assistance from relevant Discord groups, reached out to OpenAI through email communication, and meticulously reviewed privacy-related resources offered by our organization's practitioners. Consequently, I have successfully developed a comprehensive document that demonstrates our adherence to the appropriate guidelines and signifies our commitment to safeguarding privacy rights. </p>

                <h4>Things that I will do differently:</h4>
                <p>Use neutral language when solving communication conflicts. During the project, some communication problems arose, which resulted in lower expectations for the outcome. For example, although we raised certain questions about the product, some misunderstandings occurred, and I didn't address them proactively. Additionally, for technical team members, creating a pre-trained model was a significant challenge (even though we ultimately decided to integrate OpenAI API instead of Llamaindex). One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to transfer between different stages, such as from "invitation" to "connection." Everyone on the team held distinct opinions, and we didn't align them or discuss a solution together. Thankfully, our supervisor, Becky, provided dedicated face-to-face time for us to discuss these issues. However, even with this time, we still didn't find a solution due to time constraints and an awkward discussion atmosphere. Moving forward, I plan to take a minute to gather my thoughts before speaking and use more neutral language to express my constructive feedback and be more considerate towards others' opinions. Addressing these communication challenges is essential to ensure a successful project outcome and a harmonious teammate relationship.</p>
